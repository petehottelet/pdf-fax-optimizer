"""Fax conversion pipeline.

Converts PDF pages to fax-native 1-bit (bilevel) output and packs them into a
CCITT-G4 PDF (default) or a Class-F multipage TIFF. Implements the decisions
described in references/fax-optimization.md:

  - square rasterization at the source's native resolution, hard-capped at
    300 PPI (the 1-bit fax channel's legibility ceiling)
  - MRC-lite content segmentation (hard-threshold text, halftone photos),
    using the PDF's own embedded-image rectangles
  - background flatten / despeckle / deskew pre-cleans
  - selectable dithering (floyd, atkinson, ordered, clustered) with `auto`
  - stroke thickening to save hairlines/small fonts
  - lossless CCITT-G4 embedding (no re-encode) via img2pdf
  - per-page transmission-time estimate from the actual G4-encoded size

Designed to be importable (used by optimize_pdf.py) or run directly.

    a short machine-readable reason for the choice. The reason is surfaced in the
    JSON report's per-page `chosen_dpi_reason` so a DPI decision is auditable
    rather than mysterious.

    Policy (live-text-aware so a single low-DPI raster can't drag down the live
    document text around it):

      * Vector-only page (no embedded raster) -> the preset DPI, clipped to the
        ceiling. Glyphs are real vectors the renderer rasterises crisp at any
        DPI. Reason: `vector_preset` (or `clamped_to_max` if the preset itself
        exceeds the ceiling, e.g. SUPERFINE's nominal 391).

      * Raster-only page (embedded raster, NO live text) -> the raster's NATIVE
        DPI, clipped to the ceiling. Upscaling a wrapped raster bicubic-
        interpolates its baked-in text and the binarizer loses thin strokes
        ("ABC" -> "A8C"), so we never render a pure scan above native. Reason:
        `raster_native` (or `clamped_to_max` for a >300-DPI scan that is
        downsampled).

      * Mixed page (embedded raster AND live vector text) -> never drop below
        the user's preset on account of the raster, but let a high-DPI raster
        pull the page up, all clipped to the ceiling: min(cap, max(preset,
        native)). This fixes the bug where a single 72-DPI gradient forced the
        live body text down to 72 PPI even when the user asked for `fine` (196).
        Reason: `mixed_preset_floor` when the preset wins, `native_raster_upshift`
        when a higher-DPI raster pulls the page above the preset, or
        `clamped_to_max` at the ceiling.

    The ceiling keeps per-page buffers predictable (8.5x11" -> ~8 MP) and aspect

    """Heuristic photo mask for flattened scans (used when no embedded image
    rectangles are available, or for the full-page wrapped-raster fallback).

    The trick on a wrapped form-and-photo page is that the photo has BOTH
    colourful regions (sky, foliage, signage) and grayscale interiors (a
    white car body, a dark grille). Earlier rules that gated on chroma OR on
    `var > var_lo` per block excised those grayscale interiors and the
    halftone became a swiss-cheese pattern — the SUV body and grille were
    hard-thresholded into chunky black/white blobs while the surrounding
    foliage and sky were halftoned smoothly. Filling the holes with
    morphological close didn't work either, because a large interior gap
    (the SUV, ~6% of the photo) was bigger than any kernel safely small
    enough not to also bridge into the form table / message text sitting a
    few pixels above/below the photo.

    The fix is to define the photo by the BOUNDING BOX of its colour-bearing
    seed regions, not by the seed pixels themselves. Real photos have a
    rectangular footprint; once we know that footprint, everything inside
    halftones (including the grayscale SUV) and everything outside binarizes
    (form table, body text, address). Steps:

    1. Compute `chroma_box` — the mean chroma in each `block`-sized window.
    2. Threshold at `chroma_seed` to find the photo's colour-bearing blocks.
    3. Morph-close with a `block`-sized kernel so the sky and the building
       and the billboard cluster into one seed blob, and keep components
       above `min_area_frac` of the page so a small colour logo (a 60x60
       gold flourish) doesn't sprout a halftone region of its own.
    4. The photo region is the BBOX of each surviving seed component.

    For grayscale sources (or pages whose colour content sits below the
    `chroma.max() > 4.0` detect threshold), the chroma path self-disables
    and we fall back to the historical mid-variance rule (a block is photo
    if `var_lo < var < var_hi` — text is high-variance, paper is zero, the
    middle band is photo) so a B/W scan still segments its photo regions.

    `var_lo` is unused on the colour path but retained for API
    compatibility and for the grayscale fallback.

    """Find small saturated-colour fields that contain dark text strokes;
    return a mask of pixels to LIFT TO WHITE before binarization.

    The motivating failure mode: a page places dark text on top of ANY
    saturated-colour fill — a highlight chip behind a slide label, a
    status badge in a dashboard, a colored cell in a table, a tinted
    callout box, a colored form field, a filled banner. The original
    page is high-contrast and legible. After RGB→gray demotion the bright
    fill collapses to a mid-tone (~140 luma) and dark text on a dark-ish
    field has too little contrast to survive: the `contrast` text
    binarizer sees the colored area as a "dark field with light text",
    flips polarity, paints it solid black, and knocks the glyphs out —
    they arrive as a mangled crosshatch that's effectively illegible on
    the receiving end.

    The cure: in the gray image, drop the field's tone to white. The
    black text now reads as crisp black-on-white and binarizes cleanly.
    We sacrifice the "this is colored" visual cue, but on a 1-bit fax
    channel that cue was going to die anyway — the trade is legible
    text for a colour we couldn't render. Same playbook as the
    photo-region exclude: prefer text legibility over decorative tone.

    Detection (must satisfy *all*):
      - **High chroma** in the source RGB (`chroma_lo`) — saturated colour,
        not a barely-tinted gray. Subtle tints stay on the binarizer path.
      - **Small area** (`max_area_frac` of page; ~1.5%) — large coloured
        regions are photos, illustrations, full-bleed colour panels
        (e.g. a slide's lime backdrop), or signage on a billboard. Those
        have to keep their tone via the halftone path, not get blanked.
        The bound has to be tighter than a casual reader expects: a
        billboard panel inside a photo can clear the chroma seed AND the
        text-density gate but is far too big to whiten without erasing
        the photo. 1.5% of page area covers normal slide / dashboard /
        form / report colored fields but excludes signage and banner-
        sized colour blocks.
      - **Background luma above floor** (`bg_luma_floor`) — the chip's
        75th-percentile luma must be at least 60. Below that the chip is
        genuinely dark end-to-end and the rescue has nothing to lift to
        white; the binarizer handles it the same as any other dark
        region.
      - **Dark text density** inside the bbox bounded above by
        `max_dark_frac` — too many darks means a near-solid dark field
        (no text rescue possible) → leave alone. The lower bound is 0
        by default so PURELY decorative accents (a thin lime stripe
        with no text, a coloured callout dot) also whiten cleanly —
        on a 1-bit channel colour is dead anyway and a black bar
        is a worse outcome than blank.

    The dark threshold is **background-relative**: a pixel only counts
    as text-stroke if its grayscale value is at least `rel_dark_offset`
    luma below the chip's 75th-percentile luma (capped above by the
    absolute `dark_thr` floor so bright-chip AA halos still catch). An
    earlier absolute-only threshold rejected any chip whose own
    background luma sat below 110 (e.g. a dark-blue "EBITDA" badge at
    luma 108): the whole chip got counted as "text", `dark_frac`
    saturated, and the rescue refused to fire — the chip then went out
    as a solid-black knockout, which is the exact failure mode this
    routine exists to prevent. Anchoring the threshold to the chip's
    actual background fixes this for the full saturation range from
    pale-yellow chips down to navy badges.

    Whitening uses the COMPONENT'S BOUNDING BOX (padded outward by
    `pad`) minus the dark text strokes — not just a dilation of the
    chroma seed. Dilating the seed by a few pixels misses the soft
    outer fringe of an anti-aliased fill edge (where the chroma has
    already faded below `chroma_lo`); that residual mid-gray ring sits
    next to the now-pure-white field interior and the `contrast`
    binarizer's local-window statistics flip it to BLACK, drawing a
    phantom border around the rescued text. Whitening the whole
    bbox guarantees the halo is captured. The bbox is already capped
    by `max_area_frac`, and `~dark_pixels` keeps the actual glyphs.

    Returns a bool mask over the page; the caller bitwise-ANDs with
    `~photo_region` so the rescue never touches actual photo content."""

    Strategy:
    1. **Tight field sampling.** Field colour comes from a thin ring *just

    2. **Hysteresis threshold on LAB distance.** Otsu finds the natural valley
       between field and glyph clusters → a HIGH threshold marks "definite
       glyph" seeds (no AA halos, no shadows). A LOW threshold marks
       "candidate glyph" pixels including AA. The final ink mask is the
       connected components of the candidate set that touch a definite-glyph
       seed. Pixels at ambiguous distance only survive if they are part of a
       larger glyph stroke (region-growing), which preserves letterforms
       without inflating them.
    3. **Minimal cleanup.** A 1-pixel open removes specks; no close (a close
       welds adjacent letters together and fattens strokes — the very thing

# `render_contact_sheet()` is the single entry point for every per-page panel
# comparison the skill emits. It supersedes the previously separate
# `render_sample` (4-panel pipeline-stages view), `render_comparison`
# (6-up dither comparison), `render_preview` (1-panel), and
# `render_recover_text_preview` (2-panel before/after) functions; those remain
# as thin shims for backward compatibility with existing callers and CLI flags.
#
# The function takes one knob — `panel_count` — that selects from PANEL_RECIPES
# below, where each recipe is a list of CONTENT KEYS describing what goes in
# each cell. Content keys come in five flavours:
#
#   - "orig"          → the source page in colour (no fax processing)
#   - "gray"          → the source page desaturated (no fax processing)
#   - "default_fax"   → `--basic` mode (grayscale + Otsu, no MRC / OCR /
#                       halftone) — the "naive fax" baseline
#   - "optimized"     → the user's full options as passed in
#   - "recommended"   → the user's options BUT with dither replaced by the
#                       auto-picker's recommendation (so a 2-up of orig +
#                       recommended is always "what Claude would pick")
#   - "<dither>"      → the user's options with dither overridden. Plain
#                       names ("floyd", "blue-noise", etc.) map to the
#                       matching SCREENS entry; parametric aliases
