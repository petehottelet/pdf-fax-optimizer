## 1. The core constraint

Group-3 fax (the near-universal standard) is fundamentally:

- **1-bit bilevel** — every pixel is pure black or pure white. There is no gray.
  Any continuous tone must be *simulated* by patterns of black dots (halftoning).
- **Fixed, anisotropic resolution** — horizontal is ~204 dpi; vertical is 98,
  196, or 391 dpi depending on mode. The axes differ, so square resampling
  distorts the page.
- **Run-length compressed along each scanline** (CCITT/ITU-T: MH/MR/MMR, a.k.a.
  G3 1-D, G3 2-D, and G4). The encoder stores *runs* of same-color pixels per
  line.

That last point drives most non-obvious decisions: **transition density is
cost.** A scanline that alternates black/white frequently has many short runs →
poor compression → longer transmission → more exposure to line errors (and on a
1-D-coded line, an error corrupts the rest of that line). So the whole job is a
balance between *visual fidelity* and *black↔white transitions per line.*

Everything below is a consequence of this.

---

## 2. Resolution & geometry

Fax-native resolutions (horizontal × vertical dpi):

| Mode | DPI (h×v) | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `standard` | 204 × 98 | Fastest, lowest quality; text-only memos |
| `fine` | 204 × 196 | Good default for mixed documents |
| `superfine` | 204 × 391 | Best quality; small text, photos, fine detail |

Geometry rules the pipeline enforces:

- **Anisotropic resampling.** Render/resample horizontal and vertical axes
  independently to the target dpi. Don't resample to a square grid and stretch.
- **Max scanline width ≈ 1728 px** for A4/Letter at 204 dpi. Never exceed it;
  clamp and re-fit.
- **Standardize page size + safe margins.** Many machines crop the edges, so
  pull content in from the physical edge.
- **Match native resolution exactly to avoid moiré.** If you halftone at one
  pitch and the receiver resamples at another, the two grids beat against each
  other and produce interference patterns. Rendering straight to the fax grid
  avoids this.

---

## 3. Tone / image conversion (dithering)

The algorithm matters more than the decision to "just dither it," because each
choice sits at a different point on the fidelity ↔ transition-density curve.
Transition density is the cost axis: more black↔white transitions per scanline
means worse G4 compression, longer transmission, and more line-noise fragility.

### The top 5 (what the skill ships)

| Schema (`--dither`) | Family | Detail | G4 size | Noise robustness |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `clustered` | AM screening (clustered-dot) | low–med | **best** | **best** |
| `green-noise` | hybrid AM–FM (clustered FM) | med–high | good | good |
| `blue-noise` | FM screening (void-and-cluster) | **high** | medium | medium |
| `atkinson` | error diffusion (6/8) | high | med | low–med |
| `floyd` | error diffusion | **highest** | **worst** | **worst** |
| `line` (`woodcut`) | horizontal line screen (AM, 1-D) | med | **best** | **best** |

- **Clustered-dot (AM) screening** — like newsprint. Dots grow in clusters, so
  runs are long and compression is far better; it survives transmission and
  re-thresholding best. The cost is lower apparent resolution. `--fax-heavy`
  selects it.
- **Green noise (hybrid AM–FM)** — the best single addition for a marginal
  channel. Built by running void-and-cluster with a *larger* Gaussian sigma so
  the minority pixels coalesce into mid-size clusters: it keeps blue-noise-level
  detail but produces the longer runs and bit-flip tolerance of a clustered
  screen. `--green-noise-coarseness` (~2 → near blue/detail, ~8 → near
  clustered/robust) is the AM↔FM knob. Cached per coarseness in `assets/`.
- **Blue noise (void-and-cluster, FM screening)** — Ulichney's method builds an
  isotropic threshold matrix with energy concentrated at high frequencies. The
  result is an organic stipple with **no directional "worms"** and no clustered
  low-frequency blotches, so it looks clean to the eye and re-thresholds
  gracefully. Compression and robustness land between screening and error
  diffusion.
- **Error diffusion** — Floyd-Steinberg, Atkinson (and the heavier `jarvis`,
  `stucki`, `sierra` kernels, plus `edd` below). Best *perceived* detail because
  quantization error is pushed to neighbors, preserving local average tone. But
  it produces **dispersed, high-frequency speckle** — the worst case for
  run-length compression and the most fragile over a noisy line. Atkinson
  diffuses only 6/8 of the error, giving cleaner whites, better thin-feature
  survival, and slightly better runs than Floyd-Steinberg. The pipeline scans
  serpentine to break up directional worms.
- **`edd` — edge-enhancing error diffusion** (Eschbach): a high-pass term is
  added before diffusion, so glyph/edge structure is sharpened while surrounding
  tone still diffuses. Use it for the gray zone where text sits over a
  photographic background and a hard binarizer would eat either the text or the
  texture.
- **`line` / `woodcut` — horizontal line screen** — a 1-D AM screen: tone is
  rendered as horizontal stripes whose thickness grows with darkness (a
  triangular threshold profile across each vertical period keeps a hairline in
  highlights and fills toward solid in shadows). Because every stroke runs
  *along the scanline*, the output is almost entirely long horizontal runs, so
  G4 size and bit-flip robustness match `clustered` — while the result reads as a
  clean, high-contrast engraving instead of mud. The pitch follows the vertical
  DPI. Ideal when the line is bad and the photo only needs to stay recognizable.
- **Ordered / Bayer (dispersed)** — cheap threshold-map method; between the
  others on both axes. Predictable, fast, no error propagation.

**Anisotropic tuning.** Fax pixels are non-square (standard 2:1, fine 1:1,
superfine ~1:2). Every screen schema (`clustered`, `ordered`, `blue-noise`,
`green-noise`) resamples its threshold tile to the device aspect derived from
`--fax-resolution` so a dot is round *on paper* and runs aren't distorted. No
flag — it follows the resolution.

**Dot-gain pre-correction (`--tone-curve auto`).** A 1-bit channel has large
effective dot gain; without correction, midtones plug to solid black and a photo
arrives as a silhouette — often a bigger win than the dither choice itself. The
pipeline applies a per-family tone curve to the photo region before halftoning
(screens are corrected more than error diffusion). `--sharpen` additionally
unsharp-masks the photo to counter the channel's MTF rolloff.

Decision guide (`recommend_dither`):

- Photo area < 3% (essentially text/line-art) → `none` (hard threshold): sharpest
  and smallest; halftoning would only add noise.
- Photo area > 45% or `--fax-heavy` → **clustered**: keep runs long so it
  compresses and survives a noisy line.
- Otherwise → **green-noise**: blue-noise-level detail but clustered into longer,
  more bit-flip-tolerant runs; drop to `atkinson` for the crispest whites on a
  clean line, or `blue-noise` for a softer isotropic look.

`--dither auto` applies exactly this logic. But the recommendation is only a
starting point — see *Spend your eye tokens* below.

Critically, **match the screen frequency to the fax resolution.** Too fine a
screen for the dpi collapses to mud after the receiving machine re-thresholds.
The pipeline scales the clustered cell size from the target dpi for this reason.

### Spend your eye tokens — the comparison preview

Compression metrics are objective; *readability* is not. Only a human eye can
decide whether a given halftone "reads" for a given document. So the skill can
render one page through all five methods into a single labeled **contact sheet**
(`--compare-page N` → `OUTPUT.compare_pN.png`), each panel annotated with its
real G4 size and transmission estimate, with the recommended pick highlighted.
The agent suggests the optimal method; the user spends their **eye tokens** to
confirm or override it, then the final file is produced with the chosen
`--dither`. Use `--compare-methods a,b,c` to control which methods appear.

## 4. Content segmentation (MRC)

The single biggest quality win is *not treating the whole page the same.* This
is the idea behind Mixed Raster Content (MRC): classify regions, then route each
to the right converter.

- **Text & line art** → contrast-maximizing binarization (`--text-binarize`,
  default `contrast`), kept crisp. Text is **never halftoned** — it is
  thresholded for legibility. The default marks black wherever a pixel is darker
  than its local paper level by a small additive margin (`mean − ~13`), which has
  high recall on *light/gray text on white* (it pulls it to solid black rather
  than dropping it, the failure mode of a conservative multiplicative cut) while
  leaving flat, text-free areas clean. `sauvola`/`niblack`/`wolf`/`bradley`
  compute a *per-pixel* threshold from the local mean and standard deviation (via
  integral images, so O(1)/pixel and no contrib dependency), which holds text
  together over dark header bars, reverse (white-on-black) type, and uneven
  scanner illumination where a single global Otsu cut drops glyphs or fills
  shadows. `otsu` remains available as the global fallback.
  - **Halftoning stays on image sections only.** The variance photo mask opens
    with a small kernel first (erasing thin text strokes that fall in the
    mid-variance band), closes to consolidate the genuine photo interior, then
    keeps only large connected components — so gray text never gets welded into a
    photo blob and screened (a top legibility killer).
  - **Solid fills & reverse type** are carried across as *solid* black. Adaptive
    binarizers otherwise misfire on a large dark fill (e.g. a reverse-type header
    bar): inside the fill the local-contrast term pushes the threshold below the
    fill level, so the fill flips to white and only the glyph edges survive as a
    hollow stroke. Where the local mean is dark (a filled region — the mean rides
    out rasterization noise that a flat-variance test trips on) the area is kept
    solid black, and only genuinely bright pixels (knockout/reverse text) stay
    white. Body text on a white page is untouched: its local mean stays light.
  **Never dither text** — dithering destroys edge sharpness and legibility, and
  explodes transition density on exactly the content people most need to read.
- **Photos / continuous-tone** → halftone per §3. Region detection uses the PDF's
  embedded-image rectangles, but a **single image that covers (nearly) the whole
  page** — a scan or an exported cover sheet — is not a photo: trusting that
  rectangle would route the entire document, text and all, to the halftone and
  dither the words into faint dotted mush. So when the embedded mask spans most of
  the page (>80%) the genuine photo is found with the local-variance heuristic and
  then **consolidated into a solid region** — closing small gaps, filling interior
  holes, keeping only large components. That keeps *flat areas inside the photo*
  (a colored sign that greys to a mid tone, a patch of sky) on the halftone path
  instead of binarizing them to stark white, while the page's own text-on-white
  areas, which lie outside the photo, fall back to crisp binarization. If nothing
  reads as continuous-tone, the mask is empty and the whole page is binarized —
  correct for a text-only scan.
- **Text baked into an image** → rescued back to the legibility path. Captions,
  signs, screenshots and (importantly) a whole page scanned as a single image all
  put text *inside* the photo region, where a naive pipeline would halftone it
  into mush. `text_in_image_mask` runs inside the photo region: a top-hat /
  black-hat response isolates thin high-contrast strokes (suppressing smooth
  photo gradients), groups them into horizontal runs, and accepts only
  text-line-shaped components (wide, short, dense). Those pixels keep the
  binarized value instead of the screen. It is conservative by design — it would
  rather miss faint text than carve harsh blobs out of ordinary photo detail —
  and is on by default (`--no-text-in-image` to disable).

The pipeline detects photo regions from the PDF's **embedded raster image
rectangles** (`page.get_image_rects`) rather than guessing from pixels — robust,
and it uses real document structure. Pixels inside those rects get the halftone;
everything else gets the hard threshold. A pure-text page therefore never gets
dithered at all. (For scanned/flattened pages with no embedded-image structure,
fall back to a smoothness/variance heuristic — see `--segmentation variance`.)

---

## 5. Legibility preservation

Bilevel + low dpi quietly kills fine detail, so the pipeline actively defends it:

- **Minimum stroke / font defense.** Hairlines and sub-minimum glyph strokes can
  vanish entirely after thresholding. `--thicken` applies a light morphological
  dilation to thin black features so they survive. Report sub-minimum text.
- **Background flattening.** Push near-white backgrounds to pure white *before*
  thresholding so faint content survives and doesn't get swallowed; conversely,
  drop shaded form/table cell fills (gray fills become halftone noise — usually
  better as white, or a light line pattern).
- **Luminance-aware contrast.** Convert color with proper luminance weighting
  (Rec. 601/709), not a flat channel average. Watch colors that wash out:
  yellow highlights, light blue, light green, and red-on-dark can disappear or
  invert legibility. Warn when a page is dominated by such colors.
- **Robust image text (chroma rescue).** Warning is not enough when the text
  *only* differs from its background in hue — yellow on cyan is the canonical
  case: both map to similar luminance, so desaturate-then-threshold erases the
  glyphs no matter how the binarizer is tuned. The fix has to happen **in color,
  before grayscale conversion**, because that is the only stage where the
  discriminating signal (chroma) still exists. `--robust-text` finds baked-in
  sign/image text as the **union of a chroma detector and a luminance detector**:
  the chroma one catches light, low-luminance coloured text (high a/b contrast),
  the luminance one catches darker baked-in text — and they are complementary,
  because on a glossy sign one word reads by colour and the next by brightness, so
  neither alone covers the whole line. Both run the same conservative
  wide/short/dense text-line gate, **multi-scale** so thick signage strokes
  register as well as thin body text. (Text on a near-white field is skipped — the
  binarizer already renders document text crisp.) It segments glyph-vs-field with a
  k=2 LAB clustering (ink = the **minority** colour cluster, since glyphs cover
  less area than their field whether the text is the light element or the dark
  one) and **recolors the glyphs to solid black** — restoring luminance contrast
  directly. A backing is then added *only
  where the background needs it*, judged by how dark the field will be **after
  halftoning** (a mid grey screens to many dots, so the test models the screen,
  not raw luma):
  - a **light** field (a cyan sign greys light enough to screen ~¼ dots) carries
    solid black on its own → nothing else is touched: it halftones normally, no
    plate, no glow, no dither fringe;
  - a **mid** field (a gold sign screens denser, ~⅓ dots, where black would drown)
    gets a **clean thick solid white stroke** around the glyphs (binarized, so it
    stays crisp — never a halftoned gradient), knocking them clear of the dots;
  - a **too-dark** field can carry no solid-black treatment; since genuine
    light-on-dark text keeps high luminance contrast and is never detected here,
    these are almost always photo-chroma noise → rejected, never stamped.

  Two more guards keep it honest: a region is committed only if its segmentation is
  genuinely text-like (ink coverage in a sane band — rejects chroma noise from
  foliage/gradients), and the composited result is re-binarized as a gross-failure
  guard (revert anything that collapsed to a near-solid slab). The per-region
  decision (`bg_luma`, `backing`) is reported under `robust_text`. `auto` acts only
  when such text is present; on a normal black-on-white page nothing matches and it
  is a no-op.

---

## 6. Transmission economics

The output should be cheap and robust to send, not just small on disk:

- **Emit CCITT G4** (or G3 2-D) inside the PDF, or a Class-F multipage TIFF for
  a fax-ready file — *losslessly*, never a thresholded bitmap stored
  uncompressed. The pipeline embeds the G4 stream via img2pdf with no re-encode.
- **Despeckle and deskew before thresholding.** Isolated black pixels waste
  compression and read as dirt; skew turns straight runs into staircases that
  compress worse. Both are cheap pre-cleans with outsized payoff.
- **Estimate transmission time per page.** From the *actual* G4-encoded byte
  size: `seconds ≈ (encoded_bytes × 8) / line_rate + per_page_overhead`, with a
  typical V.17 line rate of 14,400 bps. The report flags "busy" pages likely to
  be slow or error-prone.
- **Detect inverted (white-on-black) content.** Large black areas balloon
  transmission time and stress the line; warn, and offer to invert or flatten.

---

## 7. Special content & validation

- **Barcodes / QR codes** — verify they remain scannable after bilevel
  conversion. They want a **clean hard threshold, never dither**; halftoning
  breaks the quiet zones and module edges. The pipeline keeps detected code
  regions on the threshold path.
- **Signatures / stamps / handwriting** — thin, low-contrast strokes; candidates
  for the contrast + thickening logic in §5.
- **Already-bilevel input** — detect (image is already 1-bit / two-tone) and skip
  reprocessing so you don't dither a clean bitmap into noise.
- **Preview before send.** `--preview-page N` writes a PNG of exactly the
  bilevel output that will be transmitted. Always offer this for fax jobs; it's
  the cheapest insurance against faxing something unreadable.

## Tooling notes

- **PyMuPDF (fitz)** rasterizes pages (supports anisotropic render matrices),
  enumerates embedded images and their rects, and detects already-bilevel images.
- **Pillow** does Floyd-Steinberg (`convert('1')`) and writes CCITT **G4** TIFF
  (`compression='group4'`).
- **numpy / OpenCV** handle Atkinson/clustered/ordered dithering, background
  flatten, despeckle (morphology), deskew (min-area-rect / projection), and
  thicken (dilation).
- **img2pdf** embeds the G4 TIFF into a PDF *without re-encoding* (the PDF carries
  a `CCITTFaxDecode` filter). No CLI tools are required. It also wraps loose
  **image** input into a one-page PDF at the front of the pipeline.
- **Input normalization (`scripts/to_pdf.py`)** turns non-PDF input into PDF
  before anything else: images via img2pdf; **Word/PowerPoint/Excel/OpenDocument/
  text** via **LibreOffice headless** (`soffice --headless --convert-to pdf`).
  LibreOffice is optional and only needed for those office formats; everything
  downstream is unchanged because it always sees a PDF.
- **Leptonica** (not installed here) is the production-grade choice for
  bilevel/MRC/despeckle if you move this off the current box; Ghostscript's
  `tiffg4` device + `-r204x196` is an alternative rasterizer when available.
