## Visual gallery — Prestige Estates fax cover sheet

The screenshots below are all generated end-to-end through the real pipeline
by the example generator
on `Prestige_Estates_v3.docx`. Re-run that script to refresh them after a
pipeline change.

### Halftone style comparison

Every screen in the `SCREENS` registry, applied to the same letter cover sheet.
The three reference panels (Original / Grayscale / Standard fax) lead the
grid so the halftone choice is always anchored to the source. `floyd`,
`jarvis`, and `edd` are highlighted as the **optimal solutions** for a
forms-and-photo page like this one: they preserve fine document text, hold
photographic detail in the masthead photo, and keep edge sharpness on the
billboard logo.

### Text rescue features

`preserve_text` (default-on) rescues dark text that sits on **any
saturated-color background** that would otherwise lose contrast on the way
to a 1-bit fax — slide-deck highlight chips, dashboard status badges,
colored table cells, tinted callout boxes, color-filled banners. In
grayscale these fills collapse to a mid-tone the contrast binarizer reads
as "dark field, light text" and the glyphs get knocked out. With
`preserve_text` on, the colored field is lifted to white **before**
binarization so the dark text reads as crisp black-on-white.

`recover_text` (default-off; opt-in with `--recover-text on`) uses OCR to
find text inside halftoned image regions and recolors it BLACK or WHITE
by the **#808080 rule**, compositing the recolored glyphs ABOVE the
halftone layer.

### Other built-in features

The 4-panel `--sample N` diagnostic gives you a *single image* that lets you
see the original, a true grayscale of it, the standard fax baseline, and the
optimized output side-by-side — confirm legibility before sending. The bottom
row shows the auto-picker's reasoning: a naive Otsu fax loses every photo, a
Floyd ED optimized pass keeps text + photo, and `--fax-heavy` falls back to a
compression-priority clustered screen when bytes-on-the-wire matter more than
photo detail.
